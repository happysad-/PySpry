##What is it?
PySpry is a tool which helps automate the building of the operating systems. This tool is being written for use on multiplatforms.

##Why?
Many of the programmers who want to create their own operating system or a bootloader follow online guides which are mostly
written for development under *NIX platforms. This means disaster for every Windows user. Therefore this tool provides a nifty
interface which will allow these programmers to thrive and expand their knowledge of their interests.

##Features
PySpry provides the ability for the user to, 
 - quickly and easily assemble bulk ASM files and place them in a desired directory.
 - quickly and easily compile the kernel files, including optimization.
 - simple creation of floppy disk images of various sizes.
 - quick and efficient copying to the floppy disk image.
 - and much more!
 
##Technical Side
PySpry is currently being developed under Python v3.3.5. This enables the tool to be able to be used on multiple platforms which
support python. These can include Linux, Windows and OS X.
